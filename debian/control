Description: multi-monitor presentation tool (ala Keynote) for PDF files
 PPC is a viewer for PDF which uses Keynote-like multi-monitor output
 to provide meta information to the speaker.  It can show a normal
 presentation window on one screen and a more sophisticated overview
 on the other, with information like a picture of the next slide and a
 clock with the time remaining.
