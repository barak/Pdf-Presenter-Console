.SH DESCRIPTION
The Pdf Presenter Console (PPC) is a GTK based presentation viewer application
which uses Keynote like multi-monitor output to provide meta information to the
speaker during the presentation. It is able to show a normal presentation
window on one screen, while showing a more sophisticated overview on the other
one providing information like a picture of the next slide, as well as the left
over time till the end of the presentation. The input files processed by PPC
are PDF documents, which can be created using nearly any of today's presentation
software.

.SH CACHING
To allow fast changes between the different slides of the presentation the pdf
pages are prerendered to memory. The small white line on the bottom of the
presenter screen indicates how many percent of the slides have been
pre-rendered already. During the initial rendering phase this will slow-down
slide changes, as a lot of cpu power is used for the rendering process in the
background. After the cache is fully primed however the changing of slides
should be much faster as with normal pdf viewers.
.PP
As the prerendering takes a lot of memory it can be disabled using the
\fB\-\-disable\-cache\fR switch on cost of speed.

.SH Keybindings
During the presentation the following key strokes are detected and interpreted:

.TP
Left cursor key / Page up
Go back one slide
.TP
Right cursor key / Page down / Return / Space
Go forward one slide
.TP
Home
Go back to the first slide and reset the timer
.TP
Escape / q /Alt+F4
Quit the presentation viewer

.SH Timer
The timer is started if you are navigating away from the first page for the
first time. This feature is quite useful as you may want to show the titlepage
of your presentation while people are still entering the room and the
presentation hasn't really begun yet. If you want to start over you can use the
\fBHome\fR key which will make the presenter go back to the first page and reset
the timer as well.

At the moment the timer reaches the defined \fBlast-minutes\fR value it will
change color to indicate your talk is nearing its end.

As soon as the timer reaches the zero mark (00:00:00) it will turn red and
count further down showing a negative time, to provide information on how many
minutes you are overtime.
